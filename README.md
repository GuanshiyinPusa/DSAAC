I recently started taking **COMP90077** at the University of Melbourne. As someone with a great love for **C**, I explored some of the most well-known algorithm books on the market. Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C was the only one that met my needs. In fact, some of the answers to the tutorial sheets can be found directly in this book. I love it!

I'm currently borrowing it from the library. I wish I could support the author, Mark Allen Weiss, but shipping from the U.S. to Australia is both too expensive and takes too long. Unfortunately, there isn’t a widely accessible ebook available online.

If I ever visit the U.S. and have the chance to travel to Florida, I’d love to get an autograph from the author.
